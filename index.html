      		<h2>About Me</h2>
      		<div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-6"><p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHello! My name is
                Jonathan Poisson and I am a Junior at the University of
            Florida. My story is pretty different from typical computer science
        students, especially since I am not a computer science major! I am glad
    you found this website and hopefully I can explain to you what goals I plan
on achieving and how I will make them happen.</p> <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe
obvious question is why music? Well, when I first arrived at UF I was not sure
what exactly I wanted to do and was subsequently what I truely loved doing.
Having played music since the 4th grade, it was an easy choice to pursue music.
UF, however, offers a program where music students can get a bachelor in music
while taking required classes for an "outside field." This path was perfect for
me, I did not want to let go of music but I know that a career in music
perforamnce is risky and difficult to achieve. After a brief encounter with
pre-med as my outside field (everyone seems to do pre-med) I decided on
psychology. My hope was to obtain my bachelor degree in music and then take my
knowledge of psychology with me to law school. I followed this track for almost
two years, but something still did not feel right, I did not love what I was
learning on the psychology side of my courses and I did not look forward to the
future.</p></div><!-- Col-sm-6 --> <div class="col-sm-6"><p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspComputer science to the rescue! I have always treated
programming as a hobby, beginning my learning in highschool building calculator
programs for fellow students to solve the quadratic formula. While zoning out
in my abnormal psychology class I came across the language of python. This
language was easy to pick up and my love for programming and computer science
was reborn. I begain watching every tutorial I could find, building little
scrips that would complete fun, basic tasks such as opening a random youtube
music video every two hours for a nice laugh. Fall of 2014 was when I decied to
make the switch that I knew was the right one for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFast forward to this semeseter, Fall 2016. Currently I
still have my Music Major and my outside field consists of a minor in computer
science. I love what I am learning and I look forward to all of my current and
future classes. My goal is to take my minor and pursue a masters degree in
computer science. I know I am behind, but my determination and true enjoyment
of what I learning makes up for my lack of a major in the field.I am always
reading ahead in my computer science classes, building web applications and
gaining experience in field by taking on various web projects while working
with the UF Cancer Research Center on more software oriented projects. I plan
to obtain a career in either full-stack web development or software development
. I have never felt this much drive and determination to create great things
and put my creativity to work.  Combining my passions with my education is a
great feeling and I know that I will not fail.</p></div><!-- Col-sm-6 -->

            <p class="projectDescription">Symptom Checker is a project I am
            working on with the UF Health web services. The purpose of this
            application is to present the user with an easy to use system for
            them to look up conditions matching symptoms they have. This
            application helps to drive traffic to the UF Health descriptions
            and information various conditions. I have learned many things from
            this project so far such as how to parse difficult to read xml
            sites into an easy to read MYSQL database, AJAX database queries,
            the CodeIgniter PHP framework, and heavy front end
            javascript/jQuery that communicates with PHP frameworks. This
            project is expected to be completed and live within the next few
            weeks.  </p> </br>

      		<br>
            <p class="projectDescription">This project is a full stack website
            I am building with the Django python stack. It will be a cross
            between the Facebook UF free and for sale page, and Craigslist...so
            an organized Craigslist for only UF students. This project is only
            in its beginning stages but I am excited to produce a website that
            may receive lots of traffic and popularity.</p> </br>

      		<p class="projectDescription"><a href="http://mubra.org/public" target="_blank">Mubra.org</a> is a project I designed to help the University of Florida Music Building keep track of Students' recital attendance.
      		    The current system uses a paper system that is slow and unreliable so using PHP I created a database driven system to keep track of recital attendance for students by securely logging them into and out of recitals when they attend. The website was built entirely in OOP PHP as I wanted a chance to learn how each step of the process works (essentially inventing the wheel for each step) but now I am in the process of rebuilding the application using Python and the Django framework. This application will be used for the first time in the Fall of 2015.

        <p class="projectDescription">Above is a link to the Git repository for the various coding challenges I have completed. These challenges are usually posted as a quick way to get an interview with a company. I enjoy doing these challenges because they challenge my coding ability and force me to learn complex topics such as different sorting algorithms, and use with hash maps and trees. <p>

        <h3><a href="pong.html" target="_blank">Pong</a></h3>
        <br>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/PoissonJ/Simple-Pong-Game" target="_blank">Pong on Git</a></h4>
        <p>

        <h4> Instructions </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Java must be running in browser and this website should be added to your Java exceptions through the Java configuration program</li>
          <li>Press 'ENTER' to restart game</li>
          <li>Hit the ball past the computer opponent 5 times to win</li>
          <li>Pressing 'ESCAPE' ends the game until the page is refreshed</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="projectDescription">Pong was another "retro" game I made in java. When I first finished the game is was impossible to win because the compute controlled paddle would track the movements of the ball perfectly. This means the player could never score. I was later able to develop an algorithim that allows the computer to move freely on its own outside of the ball's movement, therefore allowing it to miss the ball. This game was my first experience with computer AI and really made me think about everything the computer must do to allow the player to actually have a chance at winning</p>
